# YOLOv11 Image Detection Notebook

This repository demonstrates how to use a pretrained **YOLOv11** model from the Ultralytics library for image-based object detection.

The notebook includes:

1. Installing Ultralytics
2. Setting up dependencies
3. Loading pretrained YOLOv11 models
4. Testing a single image
5. Comparative display: original vs YOLO output

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [Ultralytics YOLO library](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- OpenCV

Install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
